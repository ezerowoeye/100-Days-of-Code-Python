Hello [name]

There is something a little bit harsh that I call myself in terms of me being a yoruba man-- an illiterate.

lol.
Why?
I am worse in so many ways when it comes to yoruba.
my writing comprehension days, I never got over 5 in 10.
I am good at writing them cause I know the spelling, but the strokes(ami). lol
I cant read them very well. I barely know more than 2 proverbs

I dislike yoruba exams, I didnt do any in waec or neco.

my [gender], I am a yoruba illiterate

but is it entirely my fault?
