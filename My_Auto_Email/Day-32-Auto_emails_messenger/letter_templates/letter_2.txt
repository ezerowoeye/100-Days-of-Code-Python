Good evening [NAME],
can I come in [gender]?

I have something little to share with you today
I might get too personal with this particular email.
not looking for any emotional support, just trying to pass across a message (which ofcourse is possible
you know and do it)

Tomorrow, my dad would be 69.
He died on April 14, 2018.
I always thought my family was such a super strong family until he left.

it being long years now, and it's still hard to get over, so I don't think about it too much.

So many things hurts till now:
amongst those is Never hugging him for ones (well, I don't remember doing so)
I never told him how much I love him.
and I never got to.

I was too young to understand.
I was in the early youth time, and it was my rebelling period (I hope you get this without further explanation)

now I can only be eager, eager to call him for advice like my elder brothers used to.
I cant send him part of my first salary, I cant see the beautiful smile on his face when I show him his car keys
or when I finally take him on a vocation out of the country.

What is the essence of this message?
Please do more. send that I love you text now or end the call with 'I love you mom'
Hug your mom or dad sometimes.
Watch news or movies with them in the sitting room when you at home
Buy them kitchen utensils e.g= (pack of spoons, cup.)
get them some things as much as you can afford now.

Do take them out for photoshoot on their birthday or do that AI image for them
then frame it.

[gender] show them more love.
if they never gave us anything at all initially, they are the channel God used to create us.
we basically are 100% composition of those two people.

I can only wish that I can do all these things for my dad, but now I try as much as I can to extend to my mom.
God will take care of them for us.

Ezer Owoeye, 2023.
Bye [NAME].
