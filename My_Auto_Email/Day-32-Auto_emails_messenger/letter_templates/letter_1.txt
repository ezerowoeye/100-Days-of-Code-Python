Hello [NAME],

The Value of a Smile on a bright monday as this,
It costs nothing, but creates much.
It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give. It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.
None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but are richer for its benefits.
It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the countersign of friends.
It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and Nature's best antidote for trouble.
Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.
And if in the last-minute rush of the morning or tired faces at the end of the day causes people to
be too frustrated to give you a smile, [gender], may I ask you to leave one of yours?
For nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give!
